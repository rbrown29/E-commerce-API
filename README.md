<p>This is a free deployment on render.com and it is not a production deployment. It is just for testing purposes. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The server is automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. So, it may take a few seconds to spin up the server when you make a request. You may have to refresh the page a couple of times to get a response. </p>
